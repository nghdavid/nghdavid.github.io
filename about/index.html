        I got my bachelor’s degree of life science in National Taiwan University. I finished my Master
        at the molecular medicine department in National Tsing Hua University. I studied how the retina process
        visual motion in my Master. After I finished my master, I worked as a research assistant in Academia Sinica and
        applied for PhD abroad. But after working for 9 months, I decided to change my career path. I make up my mind to become a software engineer.

        I started programming when I was freshman in NTU. I self taught myself Python via codeacademy and edx. I then took
        a programming class to learn C++. After that, I took Algorithms class in EE department and implemented several algorithms
        including merge sort, dynamic programming, greedy algoritm, genetics algorithm using C++. Besides, I learned matlab
        and used it to analyze data in my independent study. I also used python to do a lot of simulations in my independent study.
        I also wrote a web crawling program using Python bs4 package in my final project. Furthermore, I took math courses like
        linear algebra, probability, differential equation to sharpen my quantitative skills.
